# Campout

## Introduction

The campout, as well as the reselling phenomenon, primarily originate from American and Japanese community movements. Today, it has fully arrived in Italy, and there are two types of structures, either organized by the stores or organized by third parties.

## Organized by the Stores

The first case, which in Italy happens very rarely, can be represented by the recent opening of Supreme. This, in fact, has a culture and preparation far ahead of Italian stores that have not yet fully grasped the heart of the phenomenon, and therefore leave the same people interested in the purchase to handle the queue itself.

## Organized by Third Parties

Even in the second case, the situation is always very chaotic (in fact, it is up to the person interested to be clever and fully entitled to the mix), so much so that you can expect anything during those hours. For example, during the night, a queue organized by the group itself is created behind the closed doors of the store; nothing to be surprised about if the next day a herd of people jumps over the previous group with any means. Considering the circumstances mentioned earlier, in order to expand your business, you need to rely on the help of your friends or trusted people, thanks to whom you can organize yourself best with the "cavallini", that is, people who, for a fee (usually receive a fee ranging from 20 to 40 euros) will queue for the reseller, if you are clever and numerically abundant, you could organize the queue yourself through tickets or lists. So, the costs to be paid will be two: the retail and the cavallini. The initial investment may be higher if you also include the contribution to be paid to the cavallini, but you can award yourself a higher number of shoes, thus completely covering the initial costs and at the same time earning a profit.

## Tips for Success

Despite this, it is always a bit complex to carry out good purchases, in fact, some tips will be reported below to be able to get something from a Campout, for example, Yeezy.

The first thing to know is the release date, which is usually announced by "Yeezy Mafia" (a group of people who have many contacts, and are able to know the date even months before the release).

At the moment when the official release is communicated, the list of stores where it will take place is published on the site "adidas.it/yeezy". Usually these are always the same, a few names vary depending on the events. From that moment, you choose the store where you want to go, based clearly on your own availability of movement.
