# VIP Clients
## Acquiring through Backdoor

Acquiring through the backdoor means doing so with security. This system revolves solely around money, in fact, three weeks before the release of a pair of shoes, those who are part of this tight circle already have the shoes, while all useful information about what will be launched is already available about six months earlier.

## Information from Store Owners

These information come directly from the store owners. Payment is made in cash, and without a receipt. Giants can also buy more than two hundred pairs of shoes at a time, each of which has an average price above retail.

##  No Need to Camp Out

Therefore, certain subjects may not even participate in the campout, but they ensure a large quantity of shoes.

## Similar to VIP Client

This mode just explained is very similar to that of a VIP client because it is a guarantee of owning shoes under the table. Stores, in these dynamics, are encouraged to release limited edition shoes, especially if they are the best customers.

## Personal Experience

Personally, the expert recounts his own experience that happened in a well-known store, where he managed to get through the backdoor by spending from 1000 to 3000 euros. The amount is enough to be noticed and, so to speak, to get into the store's good graces with the ease of being able to ask for a prominent place.

## Quantity of Shoes

As for the quantity of shoes that the store releases, there is no stable figure, in fact, this varies from store to store: some manage to release even more than a few pairs of shoes; others limit themselves to a maximum of two pairs of shoes per person.

## Evolution of Backdoor

In recent years, the backdoor has evolved a lot in the measure in which the market has evolved: everyone wants their own slice of profit, and as a result, they also increase the value of shoes and the subjects active within this business. Each of these, with their own work, makes the price of the backdoor rise to levels never seen before, so much so that even bouncers have become part of this circle, who are often contacted by people to understand the internal organization of the store and, therefore, facilitate access to shoes.

## How to Evaluate a Shoe?

At this point, there is only one thing to ask yourself, that is: "How is a shoe valued?" There are various methods to understand how high the value of a pair of sneakers is. The evaluation will not take into account unique pieces, such as the Shattered backboard reverse, but limited edition shoes that are distributed by various selected retailers.

## Market Price

The first factor to pay attention to is the market price which, thanks to the technology of our days and platforms such as StockX, Goat, and Kicks on Fire, is possible to understand in real-time. The second important factor is the rarity of the shoe, which can be understood by analyzing the production numbers. The third factor is the popularity of the shoe, which can be understood by analyzing the social media data.
