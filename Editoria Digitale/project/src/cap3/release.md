## Understanding Release Dates
When it comes to purchasing limited edition sneakers, it's important to always be aware of the release date. There are several websites that provide this information, but two of the most popular are "Sneaker News" and "Outpump." While "Sneaker News" primarily focuses on the American market, "Outpump" specifically covers releases in Italy.

## Knowing the Release Locations
In addition to knowing the release date, it's also important to know where the sneakers will be released. "Outpump" provides this information as well, listing the specific stores and cities where a particular pair of sneakers will be available.

## Release Methods
Lastly, it's important to understand the method of release - whether it's through a raffle, in-store release, or time-limited purchase on a website. To stay informed about release methods, it's recommended to follow the stores on Instagram that will be releasing the product. They may post information about requirements or the release process. Additionally, signing up for store newsletters can also be helpful, especially for raffles where a personal code is provided through email in order to participate.
