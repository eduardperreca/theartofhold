## Cookgroup: What They Are and How They Work

Cookgroups are private groups that are dedicated to tracking the release and restocking of limited edition sneakers, both in-store and online. The group's admins use specialized software to monitor the availability of shoes in real-time, allowing members to stay up-to-date on the latest drops and restocks.

## Shock Drops and the Importance of Cookgroups

One of the biggest advantages of being a member of a cookgroup is that they often provide early warning of surprise releases, also known as "shock drops." These are releases that are not announced beforehand and can catch even the most dedicated sneakerheads off guard. By being a part of a cookgroup, you can stay informed and be among the first to know when a new release is happening.

## Discord and the Functioning of Cookgroups

Cookgroups are often hosted on the popular chat platform, Discord. Members receive notifications when a shoe becomes available and are provided with key information such as the style, stock levels and direct links to purchase the shoe in their desired size.

## ATC Links and Browser Extensions

Cookgroups also provide ATC (add to cart) links that take users directly to the website where they can purchase the shoe. These links are essential for quickly and efficiently buying shoes, but they can be time-consuming to navigate manually. To speed up the process, many cookgroups offer browser extensions that automate the checkout process.

## Quicktask and Bot Links
Lastly, some cookgroups also offer links that are only available to members who own bots. These links, known as "Quicktask," allow bots to automatically purchase the shoe on the user's behalf.

It's important to note that cookgroups are generally paid services and can put pressure on those who want to buy sneakers for personal or professional reasons. However, for those who want to stay updated in real-time and even during off-hours, joining a cookgroup can be highly beneficial.
