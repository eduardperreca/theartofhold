## Introduction
The SNKRS App is the official Nike application where you can purchase limited edition shoes. In this app, there are greater chances of purchase as most shoes are found on this platform. There are many ways to buy Nike sneakers.
## Release Scheduled
One of the most limited ways is usually released at 9:00 am on the app, but do not fall into the error of thinking it is easy. These are released with a method called "DAN", or a raffle. Once you enter the app, where you will have about 20 minutes to participate, just before the release, you must click on the countdown and then enter your information, including the size. After a few minutes, Nike informs you whether you have actually been drawn or not.
## LEO
Another method is called "LEO", used for more or less important sneakers. Also in this case, you must open the sneaker app at 9:00 am, and proceed with the purchase within a few minutes. Nike will subsequently randomly choose people to sell their pieces to. Keep in mind that if you manage to send the request in the first two minutes, you have a better chance of success.
## Flow
A third function is called "FLOW", used for those shoes that do not have a resell. At 9:00 am, they are normally released and anyone can purchase. The method is "first come, first served", so the first ones to arrive purchase until stocks run out.
