# Payment Methods & Sizes

## Payment Methods
The payment methods can vary, but usually you can choose between credit cards, paypal or prepaid cards. In this last case, it is important to remember to recharge it before accessing the event.

## Sizes
Regarding sizes, it is important to keep in mind that from 42 to 44 there are more pairs of shoes, so there is a higher chance of being able to take the product. However, for the same reason, there are many more participants in that range, so you always need to have that touch of luck.

On the sizes to choose, it is important to open a parenthesis, as you must still be well informed. The obstacle is that this information is difficult to find if you are not in a cookgroup that mainly deals with this problem.

Of course, we always base ourselves on the most common and widely used sizes, but we must take into account the limitedness of these. At the release, in fact, it is not surprising if there will be people who buy from 40-43 and people who buy from 44 and up or only women's sizes. The motivations that push the second group to that choice have as a starting point the limitateness.

The advice is to take good care of the releases, so that if women's sizes are launched, they will also be sold for men and in larger sizes; this makes us think that the quantities of shoes in small numbers are many more than those in larger sizes.

This circuit of sizes has a crucial role, because many colorways of shoes that come out apparently unisex, if they are categorized for men or for women will have a different and predominant impact on the sizes.
