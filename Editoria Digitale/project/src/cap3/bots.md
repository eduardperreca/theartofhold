# Bots
## Introduction

Bot are becoming increasingly popular among sneakerheads. They automate the buying process, storing the user's preferences, shoe size and payment method, so that the buyer can complete the purchase at the same time the shoes are put on sale.

## How do bots work?

In detail, the bot is used as a test by a shop, simulating the classic add to cart and check out operation before releasing a new product. The purpose is to check that there are no obstacles during the buying process. In the same way, bots created to buy sneakers work, so anyone using this tool has almost certainty of getting the product at a speed that humans cannot even approach.

## Strategies of shops

This mechanism, however, harms the shop. For this reason, shops have adopted solutions, sometimes successful and others not, to try to counteract these new dynamics that make all the romance behind the natural race for the most desired shoe fade away. One of the strategies adopted, such as by the Adidas giant, has been to assign the ultra-limited edition through lotteries and random drawings.

## The prices of bots

As for prices, there are bots with resell prices and those with retail prices. For example, the Dragon Bot is one of the most expensive and famous in the world that has a retail of about 1000 euros, but put on resell can reach even 20,000 euros. Other examples include Cyberaio at six thousand, Kodaiaio at five thousand, Wrath AIO at seven thousand.
