# In Store Releases

## In Store purchasing

In recent times, companies have taken measures to prevent reselling by not selling shoes to those who may potentially be resellers. Additionally, stores now tend to release shoes randomly to favor enthusiasts: something new could come out every day! As previously mentioned, these releases include unofficial releases, and the limited edition shoe market is becoming increasingly commercial. Each store has its own rules now, anything could happen, you might find your own little paradise that only you know about!

This buying method, despite suffering a harsh setback due to Covid-19, was already beginning to wane prior to the pandemic. The reason lies simply in the difficulty of managing such a large group of people, which can sometimes lead to fights and senseless violence.
