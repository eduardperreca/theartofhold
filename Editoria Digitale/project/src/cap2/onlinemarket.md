# Online Market

## Introduction to the Online Market
When it comes to the online market, there have been multiple platforms discussed where one can buy, sell, or trade shoes. Typically, it is the company itself managing purchases and sales, applying a commission for the work they do, which is bringing together demand and supply. They also provide security for buyers and sellers as each package is checked and authenticated by the staff, who attach a special tag from the company as a verification of authenticity. However, this system is not perfect, and mistakes can sometimes occur. The commissions make the value of what a customer buys quite high, so it is not always the most convenient place to purchase.

## Private Platforms
There are other platforms where private individuals post their shoes for sale, and with a search engine, you can find what you're looking for. Initially, these communities of people operated in closed groups on Facebook, Yeezyitalia, Cozycommunity, Dfc, Laced up and many others, but with the arrival of technology and smartphones, everything has changed. Nowadays, people want everything immediately and with easy use, which is why apps like Bump, Grailed, Depop, etc. have emerged. They do the same thing, but with a more optimized search engine dedicated exclusively to fashion (on Facebook, you could only filter posts, the date of the announcement, and it was difficult, at the level of search, to use the same keywords that are in the posts).

##Italian App
At an Italian level, there is an interesting app created by Sos: Soldoutservice (Sos meetapp), which has been populated since 2018 by Italian resellers who buy and sell goods every day.

## Large Reselling Stores
In the online market, there are also various sites for large reselling stores, such as Flightclub, Larry deadstock, Dropout, and many others. Prices, however, are crazy, so buying is not recommended. The only interesting aspect is that you can leave your merchandise on consignment, and thanks to their markups, you can make some extra money. On this subject, however, if you have the shoe at home, it's better to leave it in a store, where it will have more visibility and customer base.

## Conclusion
The online market, in conclusion, is the most balanced market in terms of prices, especially for those who can find what they're looking for. For less experienced people, however, it could be a ruin, as there are many sharks behind computers. The advice is to always stay well-informed about prices, release date, quantities, information, and restocks. It's important to build your own credibility online as it's the business card that opens many doors. Having a well-curated profile with positive feedback will help you in the long run.
