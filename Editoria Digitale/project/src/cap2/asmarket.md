# Asian Market
## Asian Market Growth
In terms of the Asian market, it has seen an exponential growth in the last 20 years. This is because the purchasing power of Asian customers is pushing the foreign economy of luxury goods, and not just fashion.

## Differences in Asian Policies
Despite this, the policies held by companies in these countries are different. In China, for example, luxury goods cost much more due to the luxury tax of 30% more (which applies not only to fashion but also to cars, watches etc.). Additionally, shoes cost much more, both because limited editions are classified as luxury goods, and because demand and buying capacity are very high, thus many Chinese people buy abroad, but always from their countrymen (they hardly trust other types of people). In China, releases also happen a month after the European and American release date, this is to increase the hype in a country that is spending more and more.

## Japanese Market
In Japan, on the other hand, the culture of sneakers and reselling in general is well rooted. In fact, respect and order prevail, typical characteristics of Japanese culture. For this reason, a not insignificant fact is that Japan is the only country (in addition to some American stores) in which Supreme allows camping out, a situation that does not happen in other countries, as the company releases a registration form, thanks to which you can be selected, maybe, in the days before, so "the queue" is already organized. The purpose is to avoid inappropriate and uncomfortable attitudes for the neighborhood. In Japan, as in China, there was a prohibitionism regarding goods from abroad, which were discouraged by the very high commercial tariffs. Today, in 2021, these constraints no longer exist, as the period spent under communism has made foreign brands acquire an indispensable charm.
## A new Frontier: South Korea
A new frontier for this market is South Korea which is growing year after year.
