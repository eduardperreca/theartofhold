## Overview of the European Market
In Europe, the market is almost unique. The motivation lies in the network, which has developed from this supranational organization in order to control the major fashion capitals, such as Paris, London, and Milan. In addition to the stores that release sneakers, they operate on a much wider landscape, which concerns both the clothing and accessory sectors, from Supreme to Palace, Bape and any limited edition item.

## Centralized but with cultural differences
It's almost a centralized system, but each country respects its own culture. In London and Paris, it is much more organized, orderly, and not everything is done in the open, in fact, the dynamics go unnoticed. In Milan, however, with the general chaos of releases and the general disorganization of stores in Italy, it automatically gives rise to very ambiguous and turbulent dynamics during the various releases.

## The impact of Supreme's Opening in Milan
It should be said, however, that with the opening of Supreme in Milan, the perspectives of the development of street culture in these cities have been balanced a bit. The opening of Supreme is practically the launching pad for hype in Italy, which, thanks to their marketing, will be able to fully expand such culture in our country, which also differs from the organizations of the releases of Foot Locker, Jd, or Aw Lab."
