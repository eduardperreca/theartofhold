## Introduction
Introducing the story of Eduardo, the protagonist in the modern world of reselling.

## The rise of Eduardo in the Resell world
Eduardo, born in 2000, discovered the Yeezy 350 Beluga v1 at the young age of 15. He fell in love with the product and began researching online for available stores to purchase from. However, he faced a harsh reality that the only sellers were private individuals with inflated prices.

## The struggles of finding the perfect pair
Eduardo's research did not yield any positive results, until one day he met a friend wearing the coveted Yeezy Beluga shoes. He immediately contacted the friend and was introduced to the world of Facebook groups, where the streetwear community had its roots and trades were made daily.

## Discovering the streetwear community
Eduardo's intentions shifted from just wanting to own a pair of shoes, to being a part of the coveted but "hidden" sales circle within the Facebook community.

## The birth of a new hobby
In February 2017, Eduardo made his first resell sale, buying a pair of Yeezy Bred for 220 euros and reselling them for 450 euros. This marked the beginning of a new hobby for him.

## Embracing the adventure
Eduardo fully embraced the reselling adventure, visiting stores, entering raffles, and buying from sellers outside of stores. He also built a team of classmates to help him in his endeavor.

## Building a team for success
Eduardo realized that it is much more likely to achieve success with a team, and encourages anyone looking to start a new venture to never do it alone.
