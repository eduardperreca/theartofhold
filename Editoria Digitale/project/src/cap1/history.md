# History Behind the Market

## Exploring the Evolution of Sneaker Collecting

### The Roots of Sneaker Collecting
The passion for sneaker collecting has deep roots in two cultural centers: New York and Tokyo. These cities have become symbols of streetwear culture, and they also have thriving skate communities that represent the face of this culture. According to urban legend, the name "sneaker" comes from the sound the shoe makes when you walk, "sneak, sneak", though there is no official etymology of the word.
### The Birth of the Sneaker
In 1970, the first sneaker was created in the United States: the Converse Chuck Taylor. It received immediate success on the streets of New York, thanks in part to a large marketing campaign on traditional media. This success prompted Adidas to launch the Adidas Superstar the same year. The Superstar also gained fame thanks to the song "My Adidas" by RUN-DMC, who wore the new model. Nike, who specialized in running shoes, had to wait until 1985 to create its first successful sneaker: the Jordan 1, in collaboration with Michael Jordan.
### The Rise of Limited Editions
Over time, these limited-edition silhouettes began to attract the attention of a very small, almost secret group of people who recognized and invested in the value of the market. The phenomenon slowed down until the second half of the 1990s, when other streetwear brands like Supreme and Palace Stussy began to gain popularity. The market also began to expand geographically, beyond the borders of Japan and the United States.

### The Impact of Online Shopping
Initially, buying
sneakers was not as easy as it is today. To get your hands on a limited edition shoe, you would have to wait in line for days, and only the first few people in line were able to purchase. Today, as mentioned before, the advent of online shopping has caused a major shift in the way shoes are purchased or won through raffles.

### Adapting to the Changing Market
This flexibility is necessary, but being a reseller is not just about selling, it's also about being a hunter, someone who has a keen sense for business and opportunity. The key is to stay informed and adapt to the ever-changing market. The sneaker game is constantly evolving, and it requires a mindset of growth and the willingness to learn and try new things.
