# What is Hype?

## What is the meaning of Hype?

### Introduction
Hype refers to a promotion that triggers the desire of sneakerheads. It is a sensation that is at the base of the buying and selling process, and it is also considered a social phenomenon. The brain experiences adrenaline, suspense, emotion or excitement for something that is about to be yours and that you have been waiting for.

### Metaphor
It can be compared to an addiction, aimed at knowing what the next releases are and driven by the need to stay fashionable. Hype is a feeling that relies on new prospects, such as the release of a favorite TV season.

### Key Factors
One of the key factors in creating hype is endorsement, i.e. presenting the product to celebrities in advance, before the release of the sneakers, to create rumors. Another interesting concept is friend and family, i.e. collections created by brands (e.g. Nike) in collaboration with a celebrity for a very small circle of people, which can be limited to friends and family of the brand and/or celebrity.

### Brand's Profit
At this point, it is important to understand what profit the brand makes from these "drops". Its goal, first and foremost, must be framed in the long term, as short-term gain is minimal compared to their revenue and the quantity sold by other models. The idea is to get as many players as possible into their world, who will have the opportunity to "play", experience (sometimes positively, sometimes not) and stimulate that sense of daring that will bring them to try again a second time, as if it were a vicious circle.

### Limitation
A product aspect that fuels this sentiment is the principle of limitation of the product, which becomes crucial for every sneakerhead and reseller. Both, in fact, exclude shoes that are still in the store, as they do not produce the same amount of hype as a pair of shoes online and that everyone is waiting for the release. In the latter case, the sold-out is guaranteed in the first minutes.
It is precisely the limitation that draws the boundary between the "strongest players", who manage to buy the product, and the weaker ones who don't make it in time.

### Example
When the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton" target="_blank">Louis Vuitton</a> x <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_NYC" target="_blank">Supreme </a>collaboration came out, many VIP clients who spent millions a year at the luxury boutique, couldn't ask to reserve these pieces, but had to be chosen according to a random principle to be able to buy the product, like everyone else. Some pieces of the collection, in fact, immediately after reached €10,000, and then began to touch €50,000. Clearly there is an objective and subjective value of these pieces, but it is the hype that makes the difference.
