## Debunking Myths: Navigating the Sneaker Game

### I don't have the skills to start!!!!
In the sneaker game, there are no secret skills or knowledge required to start. Everything can be learned on the job through experience, mistakes and successful moves. The best way to learn is to find a mentor who believes in you. It's important to understand your starting point, which shouldn't be money. Building a relationship with this person is key, as they will provide knowledge and information for free. In return, you provide your time. This will give you two important advantages: connections that will be important in your future and practice, learning faster with someone who already knows. If you can't find a mentor, don't give up. Be brave and show that you're in it for passion, not boredom.
### I don't have the capital to start!!!!
The sneaker market has a high demand that can be exploited to your advantage. Of course, large quantities are excluded from this discussion, as it is difficult to find sufficient financial resources. But if you want to start, capital is not a barrier. For example, during a release of AF1 X OFF WHITE in black and volt colors, you may find yourself in a campout with a friend, but with only enough money to buy one pair of shoes. In this case, you can think of a solution to buy the shoes and make a profit, without having the money to buy a second pair.
### I will be seen as a beginner and not taken seriously!!!!
Usually, beginners are not well-received by the higher-ups in the industry, as they think you're only in it for the money. The advice is to never give up and to always show that you are in it for passion, not boredom.
