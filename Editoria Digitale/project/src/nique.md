## What is reselling and how does it work?

### Introduction to the Sneaker Game
The Sneaker game is not like any other game; it is not a role-playing game where you can win or lose. Being part of the Sneaker game means dealing with reality in all its forms. Some people are able to "win" thanks to their knowledge and skills, but there are cases (and they are not few) where players, being much weaker, succumb, which is why tenacity is the first defensive weapon to be able to participate: coming out unscathed is not always guaranteed!
### What is Reselling
Reselling is a phenomenon that is now very common, and it consists simply in buying shoes or clothing in limited quantities, and then reselling them at a higher price on the secondary market. Reselling is particularly relevant in the world of Sneakers, shoes, primarily Adidas or Nike, but also other clothing items of various brands like Supreme.
### Origin and Growth of the Reselling Market
The United States, the birthplace of streetwear culture, gave birth to this movement. Today, the Sneaker market is worth 6 billion dollars and it is constantly growing. Then it took hold in Europe, also very quickly, reaching states such as France, the United Kingdom and Italy. In our country, in fact, five years ago collectors represented about 5% of consumers, while resellers were about 1%. Today all consumers are potential resellers, thanks to social media and platforms created ad hoc.
### Platforms and Predictions
Platforms, such as StockX or Klekt, have also been created by social media, so that anyone who wants to can become a potential customer. According to GlobalData's predictions, the global resell market will go from 28 billion in 2019 to 64 billion in 2024, with an average annual growth of 39%. By 2030, it is expected that the turnover will be around 30 billion annually.
### Key figures in the Reselling Market
The key figures or professionals that revolve around this macrocosm are: Resellers, Buyers, and Authenticators. A reseller is the one who identifies and purchases the product at the time of release, and then resells it later at a higher price than the purchase price, generating a margin of profit.
### Conclusion
Whoever decides to become a reseller must understand how important it is to use all the tools available to them to shorten the product identification time, most of the time in limited edition. The recommended application, and also the most used one, is "SNEAKERS" by Nike, free, and available both in the App Store and the Play Store. Through "draws," random draws held at a specific time, the sneakers are sold in limited quantities, making the reselling process more challenging and exciting.
