## Defining an event

"Realizing a large project or a public or private event that requires the presence of an audience and has a specific purpose, with a limited duration in time" is how an event can be defined. These events often take the form of fairs, where an organizer contacts and is contacted by various resellers to "rent" a stand or just an exhibition table. In these cases, rates vary depending on the type and location of the sales. Within these stands, each seller will exhibit their own goods, and this is where the importance of these events comes into play. All that variety of goods is highly anticipated by enthusiasts, as they have the opportunity to find gathered sellers and buyers at the same time. In addition, famous brands such as Stockx and Crep Protect set up stands. These brands often organize mini-games for fun, through which it is possible to win some gadgets or even limited edition shoes.

## The benefits of events

Access to these fairs not only provides visibility, but also credibility on social media. Selling within these types of events is a status: having a counter full of shoes and full of interested buyers is a huge satisfaction!
The first advantage is, in fact, to grant a good live knowledge with the various web users: the resell market is developed mainly online, and the fact that a couple of times a year they physically gather in cities like Rome or Milan, gives the opportunity to create real relationships without the mediation of the smartphone.

## The importance of events in business communication

It is worth noting that the adjective "large" should not be understood only as a quantitative term, but also as a qualitative term. Today, events represent a fundamental tool for the communication of companies, always in search of new services/products to launch, new ideas to promote and new values and images to turn into a unique experience. Very often, the same event serves as an experience, because its memory binds the participants to that place and pushes them to return as spectators or as first-hand actors.

## The evolution of events in business communication

Today, events have become a powerful communication tool, determined by the dimensions of freedom, optionality, and plurality. One can decide, in fact, whether to participate or not in an event, which event to choose, and in what way to participate and with what intensity and goal. The constant increase in competition and a market that is increasingly saturated with products has made potential customers, constantly bombarded with different and conflicting communications, respond better in terms of participation during a creative event.
