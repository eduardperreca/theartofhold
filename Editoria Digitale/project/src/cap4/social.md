## Using Instagram for reselling

When it comes to advertising, Instagram plays a crucial role in influencing, attracting, and gaining new buyers. You can use your Instagram page as a bulletin board by posting photos of the sneakers you are selling and adding a link to your website. In any case, Instagram provides several means to advertise, such as advertising partnerships or adding to the catalog.
However, it's important to be careful when selling on Instagram, as it's typically prohibited. Instagram is not a marketplace like Bump, which takes a percentage of the sale. But Instagram does give the opportunity to promote websites where you can legally sell as a form of advertising.

## Utilizing social media for streetwear

Pages on social media related to streetwear often use the technique of giveaways to reach their desired audience, known as targeting. The dynamic involves multiple pages, both established and new, which pay, in proportion to their influence margin, the prices of sponsors and the prize at stake. This will increase their number of followers, who will compete to win the desired prize by following predetermined rules (following the account, tagging friends, sending the post to other contacts).
Another strategy used to gain visibility on social media is the blocked post. This involves selling an item at a low price to attract as many people as possible. Of course, there are also rules to follow, aimed at an exponential growth in followers and visibility of the post itself.

## The importance of followers and comments on social media

In these dynamics, the main goal is always followers, and their comments, spread over a limited period of time, are essential to unlock the algorithm. Today, it is certainly very difficult to stand out on social media among the multitude of resell pages that can be found, but there is one very important factor that can be used to differentiate oneself. These pages have the same preset, that is, they post their shoes on custom backgrounds and add their logo. This differentiates them in terms of branding, but not in terms of content.

## The importance of innovation and references on social media

The advice is to always try to propose something innovative, without copying, even though there are essential elements that must be maintained, such as references. These, in fact, are the key to this game, as the more they grow, the more customers will tend to trust the seller, and therefore the business grows. Remember two fundamental factors for the success of your social media today: creating a recognizable and consistent brand, and providing high-quality content.
