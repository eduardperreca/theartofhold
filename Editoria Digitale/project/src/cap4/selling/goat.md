## Introduction to GOAT
GOAT is a great app to buy sneakers that were not able to be purchased during the release.

## Main Screen of the App
On the main screen, all the shoes that can be purchased will appear among the many models offered. In the "Trending" section, there will be the most sold shoes at that time. In the "Buy Now" section, there will be shoes that the platform proposes directly, or you can search for the ones you prefer.

## Finding and Buying Sneakers on GOAT
When you find the sneaker you want to buy, you have the opportunity to view all the product photos, even in detail, so you can see everything well. There are two purchase options: new or used.

## Buying Used Sneakers on GOAT
For used sneakers, the price, product and box photos, size and conditions are displayed. This way you can buy them or make an offer.

## Buying New Sneakers on GOAT
For new sneakers, after selecting your size and choosing the condition of the box (usually cheaper if damaged), you can also make an offer, and the platform will show you the best offer made so far. Accepted payments are paypal, strongly recommended, or credit card. Payment plans are only available in the United States, not yet in Italy. It should also be noted that for a desired shoe, you can activate notifications that inform you of possible price changes.

##  Similarities to StockX and KLEKT
Like StockX and KLEKT, the shoe will only be delivered to the customer after being reviewed by experts, so authenticity will always be confirmed before paying. In this case, however, it is important to pay attention to customs, which will charge, in case of seizure, 22% VAT (calculated on the value and price of the shoe, and its shipping) and an additional 15 euros in tariffs.
