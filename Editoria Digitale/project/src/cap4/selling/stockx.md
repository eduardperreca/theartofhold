## StockX's Features and Functionality
Its importance is given by the possibility of comparing prices at the moment, so knowing the market actions with the shoes in rise or fall. But there is an even more important reason that has made it so famous, that is the possibility of copping, that is buying, at the resell price; to sell, and to make online auctions. In the latter case, it is therefore possible to get the pair of shoes that you prefer, or other items, at the lowest possible price.

## Purchase and Sale Methods on StockX
To be able to buy on StockX there are two different methods. The first, called "Buy Now", allows you to buy at the moment your size at the price that the seller has decided. The second mode, allows you to negotiate the final price: the buyer proposes an offer, which within a week must necessarily be accepted or rejected.

## StockX's Restrictions and Regulations
In this case, the sale also works in the same way: direct or with an auction, which can last from a few hours to entire weeks. StockX, in this case, will select the highest price that has been proposed, and the seller can choose to accept it or not. On the platform, it is not possible to sell used products, so only DS pieces. In the event that this rule is violated, StockX will keep the product for itself, and the seller will be forced to pay 15% on the amount they would have received. In fact, when the seller sends their product, they do not have to send it directly to the customer, but must send it to the StockX administrative offices, which will thoroughly check that everything follows the parameters.
