# Retail Stores
## Introduction
In the beginning, when online shopping was gaining popularity, nobody believed it would become as significant as it is today. However, some people see the future in the hands of physical stores, behind the big machine of online shopping.

## Amazon and Apple
Just think about Amazon, which has conquered the virtual world, but is heading towards opening a physical store. The same goes for Apple, which within its stores provides a true experience, even with external guests, that almost ignores the original product. In this way, the customer can associate more products at the same time and analyze their value on a larger scale.

## Bureaucratic Issues
Obviously, the first difficulties that can arise when deciding to create a physical store are bureaucratic issues, especially because the dynamics of this market are not yet clear, especially in Europe.

## Marketing Challenges
Marketing could also be a first obstacle to overcome. In this case, comparisons with other stores must be made to see what works and what does not. You must act as a customer and think with their head, therefore go to other stores to see what could help to stand out.

## Credibility of the Seller and Brand
One of the most important aspects of having a physical store is the credibility of the seller and their brand. In this way, people are more likely to go to these resell stores, both because they have the opportunity to buy the most popular products of the moment, and because they enjoy total security about the authenticity of the shoe in question.

## Difference between Online and Real World
Certainly, the world of the web is changing and evolving much faster than one might think, however, there is still a lot of difference with the real world, as the various market players are still "far" from each other, if not unknown to each other.

## Prices
Another important advantage is the prices offered to buyers. In a store, in fact, the bargaining power is much higher, both for a matter of taxes and for the various services that revolve around it, unlike the online world that presents any kind of figure.

## Selling
Third advantage to keep in mind regarding selling, in the sense that not all users go to the store to buy, but to sell. Even in this case, the bargaining power comes into play, which provides two options directly from the store: instant cash out or consignment sale. In the first case, the cash out is usually very low, reason why it does not make sense to sell in this way, and in the second case, the seller is guaranteed a higher percentage of the sale, but the time to receive the money is longer.
