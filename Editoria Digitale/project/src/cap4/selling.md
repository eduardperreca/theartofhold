In the following pages, we will explore some of the top European marketplaces for selling shoes. We will take a closer look at the platform's features, fees, and strategies for maximizing your sales. Whether you are a reseller or simply looking to clear out your closet, you will find valuable information on how to sell your shoes online in Europe.

## Buying and Selling
Buying an item to resell it for a high profit margin is not difficult, but attention must be paid to some very important factors, such as the seller's reliability, customer loyalty, and purchase speed.

## Digital Transformation
With digital transformation, the process has become simpler and more effective, so much so that it is enough to have a VAT number to start your business at no cost.

## VAT Number
On this point, we must pause for a moment to understand better what a VAT number consists of. Whoever has a hobby, even that of buying limited sneakers and selling occasionally is not forced to have one. If, in fact, the income does not exceed € 5,000 per year, the products do not have a value higher than € 250 and the activity is carried out occasionally, one does not need to open a VAT number.

## Reselling
The problem arises when the reselling activity, by its nature, far exceeds € 5,000 net per year, and the products exceed the established value of at least 80%.

The VAT number remains, therefore, the only legal method to be able to resell in a linear way. There is, however, a special regime that allows you to take advantage of some tax and accounting simplifications: the flat rate regime. Included subjects are those who have an annual income equal to or less than € 65,000. The tax has a rate of 15% which, in the presence of some requirements, can reach 5%. In addition, this regime provides the possibility of requesting a reduction of 35% on INPS contributions (mandatory if you have a VAT number). In the event that the annual income should exceed € 65,000, then you would have to switch to the ordinary regime.

## Platforms
After opening a VAT number, it is essential to have a platform where you can sell your products. Buyers, of course, prefer to buy items from a verified site rather than from a stranger.

There are three ways to make this activity a real job:
- The store.
- E-commerce.
- The Marketplace.

## The store
The store consists of opening a physical store, so you must have the possibility of an initial investment to start the activity.
The purchase does not take place directly with the brand, but through a secondary market (online stores or other resellers).
The products to be purchased must be well selected, as they must ensure a high profit margin. Therefore, one must be careful about the price with the aid of special paid software or using information received from insiders.
An example is that of Dropout, a resell store in Milan founded in 2018, and now become a real reference point for the Italian and European market.

## E-Commerce
E-commerce is developed through a website, and the purchase takes place directly with the brand.
The products to be purchased must be well selected, as they must ensure a high profit margin. Therefore, one must be careful about the price with the aid of special paid software or using information received from insiders.
An example is that of Dropout, a resell store in Milan founded in 2018, and now become a real reference point for the Italian and European market.

## Marketplace
The Marketplace is a platform that allows the seller to sell the product to the customer in a very simple way.
The purchase takes place directly with the seller, and the platform takes care of the rest.
An example is StockX, a platform that allows you to buy and sell sneakers in a safe and reliable way.
